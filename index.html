          Sketch is a visual scaffolding framework for HTML.
          It was developed as an communication aid between developers and
          designers.

          Everyone makes these sketches on paper, but I wanted to flesh out my
          ideas quickly and easily in code.

          Although sass and haml aren't for everyone, it keeps typing to a
          minumum, and for that, I use it.
